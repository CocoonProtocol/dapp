# Cocoon Protocol

Hey there, we are Cocoon Protocol.

We are a DAO tooling platform to generate sustainable income for DAOs, using their most valued asset: their communities. By connecting communities with value-aligned partners, they will be able harness the power of their active contributors to provide value to blockchain companies. Value is provided by active participation in sponsored events, bounties, job opportunities, scholarships, and more. In return, DAOs will be able to grow their treasury and provide their community members with DAO Basic Income (DBI). 100% of the treasure is staked or added to AMMs to produce interest. Interest is paid out to the community on a regular basis. Interest is paid out to the community members as a DAO Basic Income (DBI). Communities can decide if some percentage of the interest goes back to the treasury (allowing them to have a higher DBI in the future).
 

# Technical Features

-Transak
We want to be inclusive to communities who are not yet onboard into crypto. For example, when we partner with local communities like Esquina de Abuela we want to provide an easy way to onramp from fiat current to cryptocurrency to start using our platform. 

-Coinbase Wallet
We are looking to onboard the new generation of crypto users to utilize as a first line of payments, Coinbase Wallet makes it very easy for a user to create their first cryptocurrent wallet and begin using it immediately on Cocoon Protocol.

-CELO
We created an ERC-20 solidity contract deployed on CELO for our $COCO tokens with a total supply of 100 trillion. These tokens will serve as rewards to activate contributors in each cocoon. In addition, tokens will act as points to earn certain NFT badges. The more tokens you earn, the more limited edition badges you get, which grows your share of the DAO basic income. The main benefit of using CELO is that it is carbon-neutral and has 5 second finality.

-Storj
We are using Storjâ€™s decentralized NFT storage with IPFS pinning to house our Cocoon proof of membership NFT badge images and metadata. This makes our NFTs more performant and secure. The main benefit of using Storj is that storing the asset is truly decentralized across thousands of nodes around the world rather than in centralized data centers like AWS or GCP.

-NEAR
We are minting the NFTs we will be using for Active members and Web3 communities using Near Protocol, this will have governance features in the near future.

-Skynet
Our dApp generates a static build using Next.js which is hosted to Skynet on the decentralized web. This allows our app to be accessible to anyone all around the world

When we deployed to Skynet, we experienced routing issues. We used NextJS, and there are documented issues with this framework. We were able to deploy our landing page, but unfortunately since the NextJS framework is not compatible, we could not deploy our whole site as intended. 

our skynet deployment can be found [here](https://2003n0sf8l9g640iup2abntct6sm9knug0ho3cjla43umia4f0arbl8.siasky.net/)
